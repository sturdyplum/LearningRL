I haven't updated this in a long time. I have been busy at work with my senior design program. During this time working on it I have gotten a really good understanding of actor critic systems, and A3C. I have been coding allot with tensorflow and feel like I have a good understanding of how I would go about implementing it on my own. I have learned that it is no easy task to make RL code that is not buggy as it will often sort of work whenit really has no right to.
